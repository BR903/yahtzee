  About Yahtzee

In addition to providing a simple game, this source code demonstrates
one approach to providing a basic user interface on top of
general-purpose I/O libraries. This program includes a graphical
interface via SDL, a terminal interface via ncurses, and a
dumb-terminal interface with no external dependencies. The basic game
logic is the same for all three interfaces, and the program can be
built with any or all of the above interfaces.


  Building and Installing

To build, simply run make.

This program depends on the ncurses library, the SDL library, and the
SDL_ttf library. You will need to have development versions of these
three libraries installed.

If you want to leave out the SDL interface and/or the ncurses
interface, you can edit the Makefile and comment out the indicated
sections before building.

The SDL version of the interface makes use of two FreeFont fonts. By
default, the program looks for the TTF files in the directory
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont. If these fonts are in a different
location on your machine, you will need to edit the value of FONT_DIR
in the Makefile before building.

There is no installation process; just copy the binary to the desired
location.
