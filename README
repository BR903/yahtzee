  About This Program

In addition to providing a simple game, this source code demonstrates
one approach to providing a basic user interface on top of
general-purpose I/O libraries. This program includes a graphical
interface via SDL, a terminal interface via ncurses, and a
dumb-terminal interface with no external dependencies. The basic game
logic is the same for all three interfaces, and the program can be
built with any or all of the above interfaces.


  Building and Installing

To build, simply run make.

This program depends on the ncurses library, the SDL library, and the
SDL_ttf library. You will need to have development versions of these
three libraries installed.

If you wish to omit the SDL interface and/or the ncurses interface,
you can edit the Makefile and comment out the indicated sections
before building.

The SDL interface requires two TrueType fonts. The Makefile attempts
to find these fonts by running fc-match(1). If fc-match is not
installed on your machine, you will need to edit the Makefile to
explicitly supply paths to appropriate font files.

There is no special installation process. If you wish to install the
binary to a shared location, just use cp(1).
